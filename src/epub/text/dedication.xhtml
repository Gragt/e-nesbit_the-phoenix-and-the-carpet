			My Dear Godson<br/>
			HUBERT GRIFFITH<br/>
			and his sister<br/>
			MARGARET</h4>
			<pre xml:space="preserve">TO HUBERT Dear Hubert, if I ever found A wishing-carpet lying round, I’d stand upon it, and I’d say: ‘Take me to Hubert, right away!’ And then we’d travel very far To where the magic countries are That you and I will never see, And choose the loveliest gifts for you, from me. But oh! alack! and well-a-day! No wishing-carpets come my way. I never found a Phoenix yet, And Psammeads are so hard to get! So I give you nothing fine— Only this book your book and mine, And hers, whose name by yours is set; Your book, my book, the book of Margaret! E. NESBIT DYMCHURCH September, 1904</pre>
